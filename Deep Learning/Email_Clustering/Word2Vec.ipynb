power drain on local utilities september in a little known silicon valley company called exodus communications opened a square foot data center in tukwila the mission was to handle the internet traffic and computer servers for the region s growing number of dot coms fast forward to summer exodus is now wrapping up construction on a new acre square foot data center less than a mile from its original facility sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones the exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually house internet servers for firms such as avenue a microsoft and onvia com exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near seattle more than a dozen companies with names like abovenet globix and hostpro are looking for facilities here that will house the networking equipment of the internet economy it is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite web sites data centers also known as co location facilities and server farms are sprouting at such a furious pace in tukwila and the kent valley that some have expressed concern over whether seattle city light and puget sound energy can handle the power necessary to run these hour high security facilities we are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting megawatts of power in a little area near southcenter mall said karl karzmar manager of revenue requirements for puget sound energy that is the equivalent of six oil refineries a relatively new phenomenon in the utility business the rise of the internet data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads puget sound energy last week asked the washington utilities and transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers the tariff is designed to protect the company s existing residential and business customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support the projects those base stations could cost as much as million each karzmar said not to be left behind seattle city light plans to bring up the data center issue on thursday at the seattle city council meeting for the utilities that provide power to homes businesses and schools in the region this is a new and complex issue on one hand the data centers with their amazing appetite for power represent potentially lucrative business customers the facilities run hours a day seven days a week and therefore could become a constant revenue stream on the other hand they require so much energy that they could potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates in the area is still open to debate these facilities are what we call extremely dense loads said bob royer director of communications and public affairs at seattle city light the entire university of washington from stadium lights at the football game to the medical school averages megawatts per day we have data center projects in front of us that are asking for and megawatts with more than million square feet the intergate complex in tukwila is one of the biggest data centers sabey corp re purchased the million square foot intergate east facility last september from boeing space defense in less than months the developer has leased percent of the six building complex to seven different co location companies it is probably the largest data center park in the country boasts laurent poole chief operating officer at sabey exodus icg communications netstream communications pac west telecomm and zama networks all lease space in the office park after building exodus first tukwila facility in sabey has become an expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or development in los angeles spokane and denver poole claims his firm is one of the top four builders of internet data centers in the country as more people access the internet and conduct bandwidth heavy tasks such as listening to online music poole said the need for co location space in seattle continues to escalate but it is not just seattle the need for data center space is growing at a rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country causing similar concerns among utilities in places such as texas and california exodus one of the largest providers of co location space plans to nearly double the amount of space it has by the end of the year while companies such as amazon com run their own server farms many high tech companies have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as exodus that may be better prepared for dealing with internet traffic management we have million square feet of space under construction and we plan to double our size in the next nine months yet there is more demand right now than data center space said steve porter an account executive at exodus in seattle the booming market for co location space has left some in the local utility industry perplexed it accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth said seattle city light s royer the utility industry is almost stunned by this in a way ',\n",

bills may not meet their may th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance bridge loan by the may th deadline any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart according to sources both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis the democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for davis many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double dip into the fund clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor however it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the long term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by july if not the state may be in breach of contract sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may th having a bond issuance by july st will be very difficult the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately billion however the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor s plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all long term contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ab x and ab x ab x authorizes the dwr to sell up to billion in bonds this bill passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support ab x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts however sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen currently in ab x senator bowen s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund for instance tony strickland has stated that only of the bonds or approximately billion should be issued other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday additionally lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount b lenders jp morgan b lehman brothers b bear stearns m tax exempt portion of the b b is expected to be tax exempt projected interest rate taxable rate tax exempt rate current projected blended ir maturity date august for more details please contact me at bill sb x passed the senate yesterday but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb x yesterday which authorizes billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority the billion authorized under sb x is not the same as the billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward again the republicans are not in support of these authorizations without the details of the long term power contracts the governor has negotiated the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the california public power and conservation authority however this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis socal edison and bankruptcy at this point two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august th however some decision will likely be made earlier according to sources the state has yet to sign the mou with socal though socal has signed it the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb x bridge loan stating that the dwr would received of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount in other words the state will get paid before the utilities if this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments ',\n",

newswires but the iso fell short of ordering rolling blackouts wednesday for the third consecutive day the iso wouldn t comment on the transactions saying it is sensitive market information but sources said powerex a subsidiary of british columbia hydro power authority x bch is the only energy company in the northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the iso paid about a megawatt hour from the early afternoon through the evening but that still wasn t enough juice the los angeles department of water and power sold the iso megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of mwh the ladwp which is not governed by the iso needs megawatts of power to serve its customers it is free sell power instate above the mwh price cap the ladwp has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare the municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high however the ladwp is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging the suit claims the ladwp sells some of its power it gets from the federal bonneville power administration which sells hydropower at cheap rates back into the market at prices times higher powerex officials wouldn t comment on the iso power sale saying all transactions are proprietary but the company also sold the iso megawatts tuesday minutes before the iso was to declare rolling blackouts for a megawatt hour market sources said the iso whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost started the day with a stage two power emergency which means its operating reserves fell to less than the iso is having to compete with investor owned utilities in the northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps the iso warned federal regulators generators and utilities wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage three power emergency wednesday but wouldn t order rolling blackouts a stage three is declared when the iso s operating reserves fall to less than and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing but iso spokesman patrick dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources in order to line up more power we have to be in a dire situation dorinson said edison international unit eix southern california edison sempra energy unit sre san diego gas electric pg e corp pcg unit pacific gas electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high priced power socal edison and pg e are facing a debt of more than billion due to high wholesale electricity costs the utilities debt this week could grow by nearly billion analysts said it s still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies will absorb the costs by jason leopold dow jones newswires jason leopold dowjones com end dow jones newswires gmt copyright c dow jones company inc gmt december dj calif iso puc inspect off line duke south bay pwr plant this article was originally published wednesday los angeles dow jones representatives of the california independent system operator and public utilities commission inspected duke energy corp s duk off line mw south bay power plant in chula vista calif wednesday morning a duke spokesman said the iso and puc have been inspecting all off line power plants in the state since tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the reasons generators say they are iso spokesman pat dorinson said about mw of power has been off the state s power grid since monday mw of which is off line for unplanned maintenance according to the iso the iso manages grid reliability as previously reported the iso told utilities and the federal energy regulatory commission wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert at pm pst gmt thursday meaning power reserves in the state would dip below and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid collapse however the iso said the action wouldn t result in rolling blackouts the iso and puc also inspected tuesday plants owned by dynegy inc dyn reliant energy inc rei and southern energy inc soe duke s mw moss landing plant was also inspected by puc representatives in june when some units were off line for repairs the duke spokesman said by jessica berthold dow jones newswires jessica berthold dowjones com end dow jones newswires gmt copyright c dow jones company inc gmt december dj calif regulators visit aes dynegy off line power plants this article was originally published wednesday by jessica berthold of dow jones newswires los angeles dow jones aes corp aes and dynegy inc dyn said wednesday that representatives of california power officials had stopped by some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate reasons the california independent system operator which manages the state s power grid and one of its wholesale power markets and the california public utilities commission began on site inspections tuesday night of all power plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns iso spokesman pat dorinson said the state has had mw off the grid since monday mw for unplanned maintenance the iso wednesday called a stage power emergency for the third consecutive day meaning power reserves were below and customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be called on to do so as reported earlier reliant energy rei and southern energy inc soe said they had been visited by representatives of the iso and puc tuesday evening representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by aes and dynegy tuesday evening aes told the visitors they couldn t perform an unannounced full inspection of the company s megawatt huntington beach power station until wednesday morning when the plant s full staff would be present aes spokesman aaron thomas said thomas as well as an iso spokesman didn t know whether the representatives returned wednesday for a full inspection aes units down due to expired emissions credits the huntington beach facility and units at two other aes facilities have used up their nitrogen oxide or nox emission credits they were taken down two weeks ago in response to a request by the south coast air quality management district to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed thomas said aes has about mw or half its maximum output off line the entire huntington plant is off line as is mw worth of units at its alamitos and redondo beach plants the iso has asked aes to return its off line plants to operations but aes has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company million for polluting we d be happy to put our units back provided we don t get sued for it thomas said it s not clear to us that the iso trumps the air quality district s authority as reported a spokesman for the air quality district said tuesday that aes could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies but choose not to do so dynegy s el segundo plant also visited by puc dynegy inc dyn said the puc visited its mw el segundo plant tuesday evening where two of the four units about mw worth were off line wednesday i guess our position is gee we re sorry you don t believe us but if you need to come and take a look for yourself that s fine said dynegy spokesman lynn lednicky lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired we ve been doing all we can to get back in service lednicky said we even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited lednicky added that the puc seemed satisfied with dynegy s explanation of why its units were off line by jessica berthold dow jones newswires jessica berthold dowjones com end dow jones

com cc subject cpuc audit report on edison the following are the highlights from the executive summary of the kpmg aud it report on southern california edison i cash needs highlights sce s original cash forecast dated as december projects a com plete cash depletion date of february since then sce has instituted a program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation s and other measures based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities sce s available cash improved through january from an original estimate of million to billion the actual cash flow given these cash conservation activities extends the cash depletion date ii credit relationships highlights sce has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to extend or renew credit as it has become due at present there are no additional sources of credit open to sce sce s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau lt generally these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a nd payable sce s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond indebtedness although there is some statutory capacity to issue more indebtedness if it were feasible to do so credit ratings agencies have downgraded sce s credit ratings on most of its rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade issues within the last three weeks iii energy cost scenarios highlights this report section uses different cpuc supplied assumptions to assess various price scenarios upon sce s projected cash depletion dates under such scenarios sce would have a positive cash balance until march iv cost containment initiatives highlights sce has adopted a million cost reduction plan for the year the plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital improvement component as follows in millions operating and maintenance costs capital improvement costs total the plan provides for up to full part time and contract positions to be eliminated with approximately of the total staff reduction coming fr om contract employees under the plan capital improvement costs totaling million are for the most part being deferred to a future date sce dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and executive bonuses have been suspended resulting in an additional cost savings of approximately million v accounting mechanisms to track stranded cost recovery tra and tcba activity highlights as of december sce reported an overcollected balance in the transition cost balancing account tcba account of million this includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of million and accelerated revenues of million as of december sce reported an undercollected balance in sce s transition account tra of billion normally the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the tcba at th e end of each year however the current generation memorandum account credit balance of billion has not been credited to the tcba pursuant to d costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the tra and revenues from generation are tracked in the tcba because these costs and revenues are tracked separately the net liability from procuring electric power as expressed in the tra are overstated turn proposal as part of our review the cpuc asked that we comment on the proposal of tu rn to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset s our comments are summarized as follows the proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of sce in that i t would not directly generate nor use cash the proposal s impact on sce s balance sheet would initially be to sh ift costs between two regulatory assets turn s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and the revenues from generating power are tracked separately the undercollection in the tra is overstated vi flow of funds analysis highlights in the last five years sce had generated net income of billion and a positive cash flow from operations of billion during the same time period sce paid dividends and other distributions to its parent edison international of approximately billion edison international used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its shareholders of billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm on stock of billion with the remaining funds being used for administrati ve and general costs investments and other corporate purposes there is no section vii viii earnings of california affiliates sce s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately million annually and remained relatively stable from through in the payments increased by approximately to over million this increase correlates to the increase in market prices for natural gas for the same period a copy of the report is available on the commission website at www cpuc ca gov dan ',\n",

attendance were ken lay the governor the governor s staff director kari dohn and myself the gov spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas he would like some additional thoughts from us by tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following monday attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governor s ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor s comments overview we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees his staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers including utility owned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost plus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at mw he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by and provide some political cover our proposals i have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided he seemed interested in the buy down of significant demand the state setting a goal of x mw of new generation by a date certain getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases as already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities his ideas the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming some of these ideas would require legislative action state may build or make build transfer arrangements a couple of generation plants the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases this was a frequently recurring theme utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost plus basis to consumers municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california state universities including uc csu and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation expand in state gas production take state lands gas royalties in kind negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies empower an existing state agency to approve coordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function he wants to hear more about how nordpool works jeff someone in schroeder s group should be able to help out here wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators securitize uncollected power purchase costs to dos jeff again i d like to prevail on you to assemble the group s thoughts and get them to kari he wants to see year fixed power prices for peak off peak and baseload not just the one year strips he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues thanks to everyone for their help we made some progress today ',\n",

financing bills may not meet their may th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance bridge loan by the may th deadline any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart according to sources both the republic ans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis the democratic cauc us is reportedly unwilling to fight for davis many legislative republic ans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that o nce the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double dip into the fund clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg islature and the governor however it is believed once davis discloses th e details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take plac e additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the lon g term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require t hat the bond issuance happen by july if not the state may be in breach of contract sources state that if the legislature does not pass th e bridge loan legislation by may th having a bond issuance by july st wi ll be very difficult the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat e would eat the billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately billion however the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for ful l disclosure of the governor s plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all long term contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ab x and ab x ab x authorizes the dwr to sell up to billion in bonds this bi ll passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lac k of republican support ab x deals with energy conservation programs fo r community college districts however sources report this bill may be am ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen curre ntly in ab x senator bowen s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be li kely to cause a socal bankruptcy according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature republic ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund for instance tony strickland has stated that only of the bonds or approximately billion should be issued other republ icans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday additionally lehman brothers repo rtedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind ications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount b lenders jp morgan b lehman brothers b bear stearns m tax exempt portion of the b b is expected to be tax exempt projected interest rate taxable rate tax exempt rate current projected blended ir maturity date august for more details please contact me at bill sb x passed the senate yesterday but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb x yesterday which authorizes billion to create t he california consumer power and conservation authority the billion authorized under sb x is not the same as the billion that must be aut horized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the addi tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward again the republicans are not in support of these authoriz ations without the details of the long term power contracts the governor has negotiated the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support no f urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchas ing power also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the calif ornia public power and conservation authority however this can be consi dered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earl ier in the crisis socal edison and bankruptcy at this point two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy t he first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is au gust th however some decision will likely be made earlier according t o sources the state has yet to sign the mou with socal though socal has s igned it the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davi s and the senate lack the votes needed to pass if the legislature indicat es that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bank ruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond is suance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb x bridge loan s tating that the dwr would received of its payments from ratepayers th en the utilities would receive the residual amount in other words the st ate will get paid before the utilities if this language is included and p assed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments

lewter retwell mail sanmarcos net claudia l crocker clclegal aol com subject investment structure structure typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate or llc general partner the general partner owns of the project and carries the liability of construction land ownership loans the property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and any land loans land improvements loans and construction loans would be in the name of the limited partnership each of the individual investors and all of the principals in creekside would also personally guarantee the loans if the investor s do not sign on the loans this generally means that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor s share of profits is reduced all loans for residential construction that are intended for re sale are full recourse loans if we are pursuing multifamily rental developments the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be non recourse use of initial investment the initial investment is used for land deposit engineering architectural design soils tests surveys filing fees legal fees for organization and condominium association formation and appraisals unlike many real estate investment programs none of the funds are used for fees to creekside builders llc these professional expenses will be incurred over the estimated month design and approval period early land costs the per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to months of extensions on closing as an alternative we can close into a land loan at probably of appraised value with a land value equal to the purchase price of this would mean a land loan of with estimated monthly interest payments of given a annual interest rate plus approximately of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees equity at improvement loan once the site plan is approved by the city of austin the city will require the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements referred to as the fiscals this cost represents a bond for the completion of improvements that coa considers vital and these funds are released once the improvements have been completed and accepted by coa this release will be for of the cost with the remaining released one year after completion releases can be granted once every days and you should expect that the release would occur months after the start of lot improvement construction these fiscals are usually posted in cash or an irrevocable letter of credit as such they have to be counted as a development cost even though they are not spent because they are not spent no interest is charged on these funds the lot improvement loan is typically of the appraised value of a finished lot which i suspect will be at least and potentially as high as this would produce a loan amount of on per lot with estimated per lot improvement costs of fiscals at and the land cost at total improved lot cost is which means to per lot in total equity the investment prior to obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement provided it was for direct costs thus the additional equity for the improvement loan would be even if the maximum loan would cover all costs it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds spent the higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the preliminary proforma to be on the safe side the engineer is preparing a tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing which can significantly reduce the cash equity requirement phasing works as follows if the first phase was say units the total lot improvement cost might average per lot of this probably would be for improvements and for the land cost the improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design costs the entry road water treatment costs perimeter fencing and landscaping and so on as well as for of the land the land loan for undeveloped lots would be of the appraised raw lot value which i would estimate as per lot for a loan value of per lot then the loan value for each improved lot would be per lot this would give you a total loan of total cost of for equity required of this was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing is depended on a more careful assessment by the civil engineer as the separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility standpoint construction loans there are three types of construction loans first is a speculative spec loan that is taken out prior to any pre sales activity second is a construction loan for a pre sold unit but the loan remains in the builder developers name third is a pre sold unit with the construction loan in the name of the buyer we expect to have up to spec loans to start the project and expect all other loans to be pre sold units with loans in the name of the builder developer we do not expect to have any construction loans in the name of the buyers as such loans are too difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process spec loans will be for to of value and construction loans for pre sold units if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender will be from to of value disbursements disbursements will be handled by the general partner to cover current and near term third party costs then to necessary reserves then to priority payments and then to the partners per the agreement the general partner will contract with creekside builders llc to construct the units and the fee to cb will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to of the direct hard cost excluding land financing and sales costs these fees are the only monies to creekside larry lewter or myself prior to calculation of profit except for a direct reimbursement for partnership expenses and b direct payment to cb for any subcontractor costs that it has to perform for example if cb cannot find a good trim carpenter sub or cannot find enough trim carpenters etc and it decides to undertake this function it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership finally cb will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is used in lieu of leasing equipment from others at present cb does not own any

power drain on local utilities september in a little known silicon valley company called exodus communications opened a square foot data center in tukwila the mission was to handle the internet traffic and computer servers for the region s growing number of dot coms fast forward to summer exodus is now wrapping up construction on a new acre square foot data center less than a mile from its original facility sitting at the confluence of several fiber optic backbones the exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and eventually house internet servers for firms such as avenue a microsoft and onvia com exodus is not the only company building massive data centers near seattle more than a dozen companies with names like abovenet globix and hostpro are looking for facilities here that will house the networking equipment of the internet economy it is a big business that could have an effect on everything from your monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access your favorite web sites data centers also known as co location facilities and server farms are sprouting at such a furious pace in tukwila and the kent valley that some have expressed concern over whether seattle city light and puget sound energy can handle the power necessary to run these hour high security facilities we are talking to about half a dozen customers that are requesting megawatts of power in a little area near southcenter mall said karl karzmar manager of revenue requirements for puget sound energy that is the equivalent of six oil refineries a relatively new phenomenon in the utility business the rise of the internet data center has some utility veterans scratching their heads puget sound energy last week asked the washington utilities and transportation commission to accept a tariff on the new data centers the tariff is designed to protect the company s existing residential and business customers from footing the bill for the new base stations necessary to support the projects those base stations could cost as much as million each karzmar said not to be left behind seattle city light plans to bring up the data center issue on thursday at the seattle city council meeting for the utilities that provide power to homes businesses and schools in the region this is a new and complex issue on one hand the data centers with their amazing appetite for power represent potentially lucrative business customers the facilities run hours a day seven days a week and therefore could become a constant revenue stream on the other hand they require so much energy that they could potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital expenditures who will pay for those expenditures and what it will mean for power rates in the area is still open to debate these facilities are what we call extremely dense loads said bob royer director of communications and public affairs at seattle city light the entire university of washington from stadium lights at the football game to the medical school averages megawatts per day we have data center projects in front of us that are asking for and megawatts with more than million square feet the intergate complex in tukwila is one of the biggest data centers sabey corp re purchased the million square foot intergate east facility last september from boeing space defense in less than months the developer has leased percent of the six building complex to seven different co location companies it is probably the largest data center park in the country boasts laurent poole chief operating officer at sabey exodus icg communications netstream communications pac west telecomm and zama networks all lease space in the office park after building exodus first tukwila facility in sabey has become an expert in the arena and now has facilities either under management or development in los angeles spokane and denver poole claims his firm is one of the top four builders of internet data centers in the country as more people access the internet and conduct bandwidth heavy tasks such as listening to online music poole said the need for co location space in seattle continues to escalate but it is not just seattle the need for data center space is growing at a rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country causing similar concerns among utilities in places such as texas and california exodus one of the largest providers of co location space plans to nearly double the amount of space it has by the end of the year while companies such as amazon com run their own server farms many high tech companies have decided to outsource the operations to companies such as exodus that may be better prepared for dealing with internet traffic management we have million square feet of space under construction and we plan to double our size in the next nine months yet there is more demand right now than data center space said steve porter an account executive at exodus in seattle the booming market for co location space has left some in the local utility industry perplexed it accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do to serve the growth said seattle city light s royer the utility industry is almost stunned by this in a way ',\n",

bills may not meet their may th deadline due to lack of support sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance bridge loan by the may th deadline any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart according to sources both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis the democratic caucus is reportedly unwilling to fight for davis many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund davis would double dip into the fund clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor however it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take place additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the long term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require that the bond issuance happen by july if not the state may be in breach of contract sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may th having a bond issuance by july st will be very difficult the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would eat the billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately billion however the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor s plan for handling the crisis including the details and terms of all long term contracts he has negotiated before they will support the bond issuance to go forward currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ab x and ab x ab x authorizes the dwr to sell up to billion in bonds this bill passed the senate in march but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support ab x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts however sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen currently in ab x senator bowen s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund for instance tony strickland has stated that only of the bonds or approximately billion should be issued other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday additionally lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan key points of the bridge financing initial loan amount b lenders jp morgan b lehman brothers b bear stearns m tax exempt portion of the b b is expected to be tax exempt projected interest rate taxable rate tax exempt rate current projected blended ir maturity date august for more details please contact me at bill sb x passed the senate yesterday but little can be done at this time the senate passed sb x yesterday which authorizes billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority the billion authorized under sb x is not the same as the billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward again the republicans are not in support of these authorizations without the details of the long term power contracts the governor has negotiated the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the california public power and conservation authority however this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis socal edison and bankruptcy at this point two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august th however some decision will likely be made earlier according to sources the state has yet to sign the mou with socal though socal has signed it the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash the second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond issuance would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb x bridge loan stating that the dwr would received of its payments from ratepayers then the utilities would receive the residual amount in other words the state will get paid before the utilities if this language is included and passed by the legislature it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments ',\n",

megawatts of power from powerex and still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the state high ranking market sources familiar with the iso s operation told dow jones newswires but the iso fell short of ordering rolling blackouts wednesday for the third consecutive day the iso wouldn t comment on the transactions saying it is sensitive market information but sources said powerex a subsidiary of british columbia hydro power authority x bch is the only energy company in the northwest region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the iso paid about a megawatt hour from the early afternoon through the evening but that still wasn t enough juice the los angeles department of water and power sold the iso megawatts of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of mwh the ladwp which is not governed by the iso needs megawatts of power to serve its customers it is free sell power instate above the mwh price cap the ladwp has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare the municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high however the ladwp is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging the suit claims the ladwp sells some of its power it gets from the federal bonneville power administration which sells hydropower at cheap rates back into the market at prices times higher powerex officials wouldn t comment on the iso power sale saying all transactions are proprietary but the company also sold the iso megawatts tuesday minutes before the iso was to declare rolling blackouts for a megawatt hour market sources said the iso whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state no matter what the cost started the day with a stage two power emergency which means its operating reserves fell to less than the iso is having to compete with investor owned utilities in the northwest that are willing to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps the iso warned federal regulators generators and utilities wednesday during a conference call that it would call a stage three power emergency wednesday but wouldn t order rolling blackouts a stage three is declared when the iso s operating reserves fall to less than and power is interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing but iso spokesman patrick dorinson said it would call a stage three only as a means of attracting additional electricity resources in order to line up more power we have to be in a dire situation dorinson said edison international unit eix southern california edison sempra energy unit sre san diego gas electric pg e corp pcg unit pacific gas electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of the high priced power socal edison and pg e are facing a debt of more than billion due to high wholesale electricity costs the utilities debt this week could grow by nearly billion analysts said it s still unclear whether retail customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity rates or if companies

aes to return its off line plants to operations but aes has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the company million for polluting we d be happy to put our units back provided we don t get sued for it thomas said it s not clear to us that the iso trumps the air quality district s authority as reported a spokesman for the air quality district said tuesday that aes could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off line plants in case of power emergencies but choose not to do so dynegy s el segundo plant also visited by puc dynegy inc dyn said the puc visited its mw el segundo plant tuesday evening where two of the four units about mw worth were off line wednesday i guess our position is gee we re sorry you don t believe us but if you need to come and take a look for yourself that s fine said dynegy spokesman lynn lednicky lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps which could pose a safety hazard if not repaired we ve been doing all we can to get back in service lednicky said we even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited lednicky added that the puc seemed satisfied with dynegy s explanation of why its units were off line by jessica berthold dow jones newswires jessica berthold dowjones com end dow jones
